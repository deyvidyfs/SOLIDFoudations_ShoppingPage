# SOLIDFoudations_ShoppingPage

Hello!

This is a companion app for the SOLID Foundations presentation given on the 35th CocoaHeads Campinas.

The premise here is that this is Shopping App that has its Cart and Order Creation sections on the same page, as a way of giving the user a more fluid experience, according to the business area.

On this project, you'll find a partial refactor of this part of the app. The objective is to illustrate the gains you can have when keeping SOLID principles in mind when you're coding or refactoring production implementations, whithout necessarily overworking your code to be 100% compliant with all of them.

Here, I applied the MVVM Pattern to the Spaghetti Code, while also changing the code to be somewhat the SOLID principles.

Have fun on exploring it!
If you have any questions or suggestions, just hit me up!

All the best,
